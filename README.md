# Football-Player-Recommender-System
    - A machine learning project created by Bao Minh, Ngoc Minh, and Thai in order to create a football player recommender system. In this project, we use central defender's KPIs and use those to find and replace Virgil van Dijk.
    - The dataset is taken from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivovinco/20222023-football-player-stats. I modified it to fit my KPIs: https://github.com/UrekMinhzino/Football-Player-Recommender-System/blob/dfa02d420c2586b4bf4bb9ce57dcd8ae69e17490/Data/Used_KPIs_to_model.txt.
    - Feel free to modify the program, adjust the KPIs to the corresponding postion, for example, find the player to replace Lionel Messi :)
